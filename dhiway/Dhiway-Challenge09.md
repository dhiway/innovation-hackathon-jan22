# ONDC Innovation Hackathon - Jan 2022

This is a submission from Dhiway for ONDC Innovation Hackathon held during Jan 7th, 8th and 9th of 2022.

## GOAL - Distributed Ledger for Network

### Description
The objective of this challenge is to create and maintain a distributed ledger of open data in ONDC.

This challenge had 3 mandatory requirement to complete, and 1 optional.


### Demo:

Step0 : Start CORD network (in dev mode), or Use [staging.cord.network](https://apps.cord.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fstaging.cord.network#/explorer)
Step1 : Clone cord.js (cord SDK) repository
Step2 : Check for details available @ [subql.cord.network](https://subql.cord.network)

Step3 : Run the ONDC demo script from cord.js repo

`yarn ts-node demo/src/ondc-demo.ts --trace-warnings`

Step4 : Check for the events in chain. Also now perform the queries in subql to see the transformations.


### Assumptions

* CORD.network is assumed as layer1 network in this project. Enthusiasts can pick the code and try to port it to other networks.
* A 'product' focused Pallet (or component) to CORD chain is added, which would handle many things
